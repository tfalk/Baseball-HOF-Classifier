    "If you have ever lisen to sports talk radio you know just how much people love to argue about who belongs in the various sports Hall of Fames. This is espically true for baseball, where the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY has a rich history being founded in 1939. It is considered the ultimate honor to be enshrined amoung the games best. One such player under consideration is Chase Utley, who for about a decade was considered the best second baseman in baseball. On his first year on the ballot he recieved 28.8% of the vote (75% is needed for induction). Players vote totals typically increase on future votes, so the question is will it increase enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to see if we could use machine learning to come up with a model that could accurate predict which players should be inducted based on the stats based on the their career statistics, and apply it to borderline players, such as Utley."

A problem with our model is that is agnostic to postion, it treats postion players the same no matter their actual postion. This is a simplification as players will get credit from voters for playing more defensively demanding postions (like catcher and shortstop). Utley played an important postion (second baseman) so perhaps limiting the model to only his postional peers will create a better model."

    "Looking at the players that form our set of false negative and false positives, we can see a couple of limitations of our model. The first of which we already examined is that it does not account for the different defensive postions that postion players are, although sorting by postions would most likely leave our training set too small. Another is that the real Hall of Famer rewards players that have really great peaks, the real Hall is much more likely to induct a player who was the best player in baseball for a number of years than our model which rewards longevity and sustained if unspectactular performance. If we ran another iteriation of the model it would be interesting to include the number of yearly awards won to try to better capture a players peak. And finally the model does not account for different eras that a player plays in, the model does not adjust for this but the voters certainly do.\n",

    "Ultimately our model experiement shows why a Machine Learning model will never replace the writers who vote on the Hall of Fame.  It is impossible to incorporate the human element of baseball and sports in a ML model, but it does reveal interesting differences in the models and writers priorities and players from the past that may have been overlooked."
